A minimalist minecraft launcher for singleplayer forge only, currently in development, featuring :

-> No need to use a microsoft account (open source)

-> MC version selection

-> Mods (Add and Remove any mod as you need)

-> Customisation : use any picture as the background

You need to set your JAVA_HOME env. variable to a 1.8 JDK to run the instances.
The current working versions are 1.21.8, 1.16.5, 1.12.2.
Have fun!
