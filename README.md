A minimalist minecraft launcher currently in development, featuring :

-> No need to use a microsoft account (open source).
-> MC version selection.
-> Mods (Add and Remove any mod as you need).

You need to set your JAVA_HOME env. variable to a 1.8 JDK to run the instances.
The current working versions for me are 1.21.8, 1.16.5, 1.12.2.
Have fun!
